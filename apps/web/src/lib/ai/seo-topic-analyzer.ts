**Korrali Revenue** — detects failed payments, revenue leakage, and billing anomalies for Stripe-based SaaS companies. Buyers: founders, CTOs, RevOps at subscription SaaS companies.

- Map clearly to one of the two products
- Represent a recurring pain (multiple posts backing it)
- Have commercial or informational search intent worth ranking for
